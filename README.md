# Developer Work & Tools Survey

## Overview 

This project analyzes the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey to understand how different factors affect developers’ salaries, job satisfaction, and tool usage across the top 10 countries. 
First: Focused on survey reliability, company tool preferences versus developer preferences, and the most common resources developers use to learn coding.
Second: Investigated the impact of AI tools on developers’ salaries, satisfaction, and adoption across countries.
Third: Examined how work arrangements (remote, hybrid, in-person) influence job satisfaction, salary, AI adoption, and technology preferences.
The goal of this project is to provide insights into how job role, education, AI usage, and work conditions shape the professional experience of developers worldwide.


## Dataset:
The dataset is based on the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, which gathered responses from 65,000+ developers across 180+ countries.
For our project, we focused on three main themes shaping today’s developer experience:
Education, AI, Work Arrangement


● Analysis: Summary of your analysis and key findings. 
● How to Run: Instructions for running your code.
